<font size="5" face="WildWest"><pre><b>There are many important and amazing applications of artificial intelligence,
    and artificial intelligence has reached a huge degree of progress,
    and it has made very important contributions in many areas,
    in addition to becoming essential in many areas, and in the following we will mention some of these
    contributions and areas that benefit from Artificial intelligence.</b></pre></font>
    <font face="arial"><b><h2> Many fields have developed due to artificial intelligence,including: </h2></b></font>
    <ul>
     <li> <b><h1>Agriculture</h1></b> </li>
     <font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre> In agriculture new AI advancements show improvements in gaining yield and
          to increase the research and development of growing crops. New artificial
        intelligence now predicts the time it takes for a crop like a tomato to be ripe and ready for
         picking thus increasing efficiency of farming. These advances go on
        including Crop and Soil Monitoring, Agricultural Robots, and Predictive Analytics. Crop and soil 
        monitoring uses new algorithms and data collected on the field
        to manage and track the health of crops making it easier and more sustainable for the farmers.

        More specializations of AI in agriculture is one such as greenhouse automation, simulation, modeling, and optimization techniques.
        Due to the increase in population and the growth of demand for food in the future, there will need to be at least a 70% increase in yield from agriculture to
        sustain this new demand. More and more of the public perceives that the adaption of these new techniques and the use of Artificial intelligence will help
         reach that goal.

     <li><h1><b> Cybersecurity </b></h1></li>
     <font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre>The cybersecurity arena faces significant challenges
          in the form of large-scale hacking attacks of different types that harm organizations of all kinds and create
        billions of dollars in business damage. Artificial intelligence and Natural Language 
        Processing (NLP) has begun to be used by security companies - for example,
        SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions. The more advanced of 
        these solutions use AI and NLP to automatically sort the data in networks
        into high risk and low-risk information. This enables security teams to focus on the attacks
         that have the potential to do real harm to the organization, and not
        become victims of attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Malware and others.

     </pre></b></font>
     <li><h1><b> Education </b></h1></li>
     <font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre>AI tutors could allow for students to get extra, one-on-one help. They could also reduce anxiety and stress for some students, that may be caused by tutor labs
        or human tutors. In future classrooms, ambient informatics can play a beneficial role. Ambient informatics is the idea that information is everywhere in the
        environment and that technologies automatically adjust to your personal preferences. Study devices could be able to create lessons, problems, and games to
        tailor to the specific student's needs, and give immediate feedback.
        <center><img src="learn.jpg" width="60%"></center>
        But AI can also create a disadvantageous environment with revenge effects, if technology is inhibiting society from moving forward and causing negative,
        unintended effects on society. An example of a revenge effect is that the extended use of technology may hinder studentsâ€™ ability to focus and stay on task
        instead of helping them learn and grow. Also, AI has been known to lead to the loss of both human agency and simultaneity.

     <li><h1><b> Finance </b></h1></li> 
     <font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre>Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation.
        The use of AI in banking can be traced back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in the US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the
        unauthorized use of debit cards. Programs like Kasisto and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.
        Banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes
        overnight or when business is not taking place. In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition. AI has also reduced fraud
        and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.
        AI is increasingly being used by corporations. Jack Ma has controversially predicted that AI CEO's are 30 years away.
        The use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories. For example, AI
        -based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of supply and demand in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply
        curves and thus individualized pricing. Furthermore, AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus making markets more efficient while
        reducing the volume of trades[citation needed]. Furthermore, AI in the markets limits the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more
        efficient.Other theories where AI has had impact include in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning point,
        portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking.In August 2019, the AICPA introduced an AI training course for accounting professionals.

     <li><h1><b> Military </b></h1></li> 
     <font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre>The United States and other nations are developing AI applications for a range of military functions. The main military applications of Artificial Intelligence and
        Machine Learning are to enhance C2, Communications, Sensors, Integration and Interoperability. AI research is underway in the fields of intelligence
        collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, command and control, and in a variety of semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.
         Artificial Intelligence technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions,
        target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Join Fires between networked combat vehicles and tanks also
        inside Manned and Unmanned Teams (MUM-T). AI has been incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.
        <center><img src="army.jpg" width="60%"></center>
        Worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from US$5.1 billion in 2010 to US$7.5 billion in 2015.
        Military drones capable of autonomous action are widely considered a useful asset.
         Many artificial intelligence researchers seek to distance themselves from military
        applications of AI.
