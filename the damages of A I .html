<b><h2> Besides the amazing advantages of artificial intelligence, it also has disadvantages, including: </h2></b>
<b><h1> <color  style="color:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.486)"> Disadvantages</color> of Artificial Intelligence </h1></b>
<ol type="1">
<h1><b><li> High Costs </li></b></h1>
<font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre> The ability to create a machine that can simulate human intelligence is no small feat. It requires plenty
    of time and resources and can cost a huge deal of money. AI also needs to operate on the latest hardware and software to stay updated and meet the latest
    requirements, thus making it quite costly.</pre></b></font>
<h1><b><li> No creativity </li></b></h1>
<font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre> A big disadvantage of AI is that it cannot learn to think outside the box. AI is capable of learning over
    time with pre-fed data and past experiences, but cannot be creative in its approach. A classic example
    is the bot <a href="https://www.quill.org/" target="_blank"> Quill </a> who can write Forbes earning reports. These reports only contain data and facts already
    provided to the bot. Although it is impressive that a bot can write an article on its own, it lacks the human
    touch present in other Forbes articles. </pre></b></font>
<h1><b><li> Increase in Unemployment </li></b></h1>
<font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre> Perhaps one of the biggest disadvantages of artificial intelligence is that AI is slowly replacing a
    number of repetitive tasks with bots. The reduction in the need for human interference has resulted in
    the death of many job opportunities. A simple example is the chatbot which is a big advantage to
    organizations, but a nightmare for employees. A study by McKinsey predicts that AI will replace at least 30 percent of human labour by 2030.

</pre></b></font>
<h1><b><li> Make Humans Lazy </li></b></h1>
<font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre> AI applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive tasks. Since we do not have to
    memorize things or solve puzzles to get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less. This
    addiction to AI can cause problems to future generations.</pre></b></font>
<h1><b><li> No Ethics </li></b></h1>
<font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre> Ethics and morality are important human features that can be difficult to incorporate into an AI. The
rapid progress of AI has raised a number of concerns that one day, AI will grow uncontrollably, and
eventually wipe out humanity. This moment is referred to as the AI singularity.
</pre></b></font>
<h1><b><li> Other things </li></b></h1>
<font size="4" face="arial"><b><pre> Machines can easily lead to destruction if the implementation of machine put in the wrong hands the results
are hazardous for human beings.In addition to The difficulties with software development for AI implementation are that the development of software
is slow and expensive. Few efficient programmers are available to develop software to implement artificial intelligence.</pre></b></font>
